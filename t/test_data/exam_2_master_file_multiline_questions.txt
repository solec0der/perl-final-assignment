Complete this exam by placing an 'X' in the box
beside the single correct answer of each question,
like so:

    [ ] This is not the correct answer
    [ ] This is not the correct answer either
    [ ] This is an incorrect answer
    [X] This is the correct answer
    [ ] This is an irrelevant answer

WARNING: Each question has only one correct answer.
         If two or more boxes are marked with an 'X',
         the answer will be scored as zero.

________________________________________________________________________________


1.  If the array @x contains four elements,
    how many elements will be in the list (1, @x, 2)?

    [X] Six:   because the four array elements will be flattened into the list
    [ ] Eight: because 1 * 4 * 2 = 8
    [ ] Three: because the array will become a single element within the list
    [ ] Two:   because Perl ignores non-scalar variables in a list constructor
    [ ] None:  because it won't compile; arrays can't be used in list constructors

________________________________________________________________________________


2.  Which one of the following subroutine declarations correctly declares
    a subroutine that can must be called with at least two arguments
    but which may also be called with more than two arguments?

    [X] sub two_or_more ($flag, @data)           {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($data, $flag)           {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, $data = @extras) {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, ...)             {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more (@flags, @data_set)      {...}
